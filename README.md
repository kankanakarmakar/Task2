# Task2
The code begins by importing essential libraries like pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn for static plotting, and plotly.express for interactive visualizations. It then reads the Titanic dataset using pd.read_csv() and displays the first five rows for a quick overview. Using .info() and .describe(), it provides insights into column types, missing values, and numerical summaries. The .isnull().sum() line helps identify missing data counts per column. A heatmap from Seaborn visualizes these missing values. The code proceeds to plot a histogram of the 'Age' column using Matplotlib to view its distribution, and a Seaborn boxplot of 'Fare' grouped by 'Pclass' to observe pricing differences by class. It then uses Plotly to create an interactive pie chart of gender distribution and an interactive bar plot showing survival counts grouped by gender. Finally, it uses a Seaborn pairplot to visualize pairwise relationships between features like 'Survived', 'Pclass', 'Age', and 'Fare', helping to observe clustering and correlation patterns. These steps together allow both statistical understanding and visual exploration of the Titanic dataset.
